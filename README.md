# Flowers-Classifications

This repository contains the code and dataset for a flower classification project. The goal of this project is to classify different types of flowers using machine learning models.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following directories and files:

- `daisy/` - Contains the dataset and images for daisy flowers.
- `dandelion/` - Contains the dataset and images for dandelion flowers.
- `rose/` - Contains the dataset and images for rose flowers.
- `sunflower/` - Contains the dataset and images for sunflower flowers.
- `tulip/` - Contains the dataset and images for tulip flowers.
- `Classification.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for training and testing the classification model.
- `app.py` - Python script to deploy the model.
- `README.md` - This readme file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flowers-Classifications.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the model:

1. Open the `Classification.ipynb` file and run the cells to train the model.
2. After training, the model will be saved and can be used for predictions.

To use the model for predictions:

1. Run the `app.py` script.
2. The application will load the trained model and classify the flower images.
