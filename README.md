# 🌸 Flowers Classification 🌸

Welcome to the **Flowers Classification** project! 🌼🌷 The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify different types of flowers with high accuracy using images. The flowers included are **Daisy**, **Dandelion**, **Rose**, **Sunflower**, and **Tulip**. 

Whether you're a budding data scientist, a machine learning enthusiast, or just love flowers 🌸, this project offers a hands-on experience in building and deploying an image classification model.

## 🌱 Project Overview

In this project, you will find everything you need to train, test, and deploy a machine learning model that can identify flowers based on their images. The project is organized as follows:

- `daisy/` - Contains flower images for **Daisy**.
- `dandelion/` - Contains flower images for **Dandelion**.
- `rose/` - Contains flower images for **Rose**.
- `sunflower/` - Contains flower images for **Sunflower**.
- `tulip/` - Contains flower images for **Tulip**.
- `Classification.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook where the magic happens! Here we train the model, evaluate its performance, and test the classification.
- `app.py` - The Python script for deploying your trained model as an application.
- `README.md` - The file you’re reading right now!

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flowers-Classifications.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure to install the necessary libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the model:**
   - Open `Classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run the cells to load the dataset, train the classification model, and evaluate its performance.

4. **Deploy the model:**
   - Once the model is trained, you can use `app.py` to deploy it.
   - This script will allow you to make predictions on new flower images.

## 🌺 Key Features

- **Multi-Class Classification:** Classify between five flower categories: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip.
- **Deep Learning:** Built with popular libraries like TensorFlow/Keras for powerful image classification.
- **Interactive Deployment:** Deploy the trained model with a Python script and make predictions in real time!

## 📸 Example Output

Here’s an example of how the model performs on different flower images:

- **Input:** A photo of a sunflower 🌻
- **Output:** The model classifies it as **Sunflower** with an accuracy of 95%.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have these dependencies installed to run the project:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (for model training)
- Flask (for deploying the model)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the code)

---

## 🌟 Usage

To test the classification with a new image:

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Upload a flower image** and the model will classify it for you!
